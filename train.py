"""Example code for the DSC 140B SoCalGuessr project.

This example code trains a simple logistic regression model on the training images. It
is not meant to be a strong baseline -- it's just an example that shows you how to load
the data and how to export the model's weights.

This file is paired with `predict.py`, which loads the saved model and uses it to make
predictions on the test set.

Your training code does not *need* to look like this file, and you are allowed to use
any model and training procedure you'd like. However, you *can* use this file as a
starting point if you want.
